# Icons

This directory contains manually installed icon themes and cursor themes
I use on my desktop environment.

These are not managed by the system package manager and are safe to
include in version control.

## Installation

To install them for your user:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/icons
cp -r * ~/.local/share/icons/
```
