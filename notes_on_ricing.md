In the Linux world, it refers to customizing the appearance of things like:

- Window borders and themes
- GTK/QT styles
- Fonts and icon packs
- Terminal colors and prompts

**Note:** This dotfiles repository is focused on usability, performance,
and a consistent development environment — not on visual theming.
That said, ricing and usability aren't mutually exclusive. You might see
references or ideas borrowed from the *ricing* community in future
experiments or side branches.
