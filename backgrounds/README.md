# Backgrounds

This directory contains wallpapers and background images I use on my
desktop environment.

## Installation

To install them for your user:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/share/backgrounds
cp -r * ~/.local/share/backgrounds/
```

## Setting the wallpaper in XFCE 4.12

After copying the wallpapers, you can set one as your background in two ways:

- **Right-click method**:
  Right-click anywhere on the desktop and select **Desktop Settings...**.
  In the **Desktop** dialog, go to the **Background** tab and choose the image
  you want.

- **Settings menu method**:
  Go to **Settings > Desktop** to open the same **Desktop** dialog and select a
  wallpaper under the **Background** tab.

Changes take effect immediately once a wallpaper is selected.
