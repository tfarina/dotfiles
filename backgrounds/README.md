# Backgrounds

This directory contains wallpapers and background images I use on my
desktop environment.

## Installation

XFCE 4.12 doesn't always load icons, themes, or backgrounds correctly
from `~/.local/share`, so it's recommended to install them system-wide
instead.

To install for all users (requires root), use the provided `install-assets.sh`
script:

```bash
cd ~/dotfiles
./install-assets.sh
```

## Setting the wallpaper in XFCE 4.12

After copying the wallpapers, you can set one as your background in two ways:

- **Right-click method**:
  Right-click anywhere on the desktop and select **Desktop Settings...**.
  In the **Desktop** dialog, go to the **Background** tab and choose the image
  you want.

- **Settings menu method**:
  Go to **Settings > Desktop** to open the same **Desktop** dialog and select a
  wallpaper under the **Background** tab.

Changes take effect immediately once a wallpaper is selected.
